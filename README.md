#Overview
This here is a Genesis Starter Theme _using the Genesis Sample Theme_. I built this using Bourbon for the SASS library and Neat, as a CSS Grid Framework Alternative to Foundation and Bootstrap. Also inspired by my other project called 'Some Like it Neat,' which is a Starter Theme using _s Bourbon and Neat

This project is still very, very early and I've not given a ton of thought to what else I'll do with it. Contributions welcome.

###What's to know?
Not too much, actually.

You need to have Genesis to use this theme, so there's that.

I ripped out all the styles from the Genesis Sample Child Theme Stylesheet and separated them out into specific CSS files. I was attempting to follow some SMACSS principles when organizing the SASS files. I haven't "SASSified" any of the Sample Child Theme CSS

###I ripped out all the CSS!
**WTF!!? Why, you f*cker??**
Personally, I grew to love that starter themes like _s (http://underscores.me) have no styling. You simply "build up". So I wanted to take the same approach and start with a very lean baseline for the CSS. 

For now, I've commented out all the styles except for Navigation (sass/layout/navigation/_navigation.scss) and Reset/Normalize Rules
